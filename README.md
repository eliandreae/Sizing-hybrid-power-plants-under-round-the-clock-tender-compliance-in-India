# Sizing-hybrid-power-plants-under-round-the-clock-tender-compliance-in-India

This repository is a compilation of my work for my Master's Thesis at the Technical University of Denmark, DTU. 

India aims to quadruple its renewable electricity capacity by 2030, using auction-based renewable power tenders as a mechanism to achieve that goal.
An optimization problem to optimise a power producerâ€™s plant sizing for this tariff-based bidding process is formulated. The outcome is an investment optimisation model for a hybrid power system that complies with the specific Round-the-Clock tender criteria.
